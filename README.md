# 🚦 Smart Pedestrian and Vehicle Detection System

This project uses a **pre-trained MobileNet-SSD model** to detect **persons** and **vehicles** in a video and simulate a smart signaling system (like traffic lights) based on majority detection.

---

## 📌 **Overview**

The system:

* Takes a video input.
* Detects objects frame-by-frame using **MobileNet-SSD**.
* Counts the number of **persons** and **vehicles** in each frame.
* Displays a 🟢 **green**, 🔴 **red**, or 🟡 **yellow** circle to simulate a **traffic signal** based on which group is in majority.
* Generates an output video with **bounding boxes**, **labels**, and **signal indicators**.

---

## 🧠 **Features**

* 🎯 **Real-time object detection** using OpenCV's DNN module.
* ⚡ **Fast inference** using MobileNet-SSD (Caffe model).
* 🔁 **Simple decision-making logic** to simulate smart signal control.
* 🖼️ **Visual overlays**: bounding boxes, labels, and traffic-like signal circles.

---

## 🛠️ **Technologies Used**

* `Python`
* `OpenCV`
* `MobileNet-SSD (Caffe Model)`
* `Google Colab` (for demonstration & execution)

---

## 📽️ **How It Works**

1. Upload a video file via **Google Colab**.
2. The script processes **every alternate frame**:

   * Detects objects like `person`, `car`, `bus`, `motorbike`, etc.
   * Counts detected **persons** and **vehicles**.
   * Adds **bounding boxes** and **confidence scores**.
   * Displays **signal indicator** (🟢 / 🔴 / 🟡) based on counts.
3. Saves and allows download of the **output video**.

## 📁 **Project Files**

* `MobileNetSSD_deploy.prototxt` – Model configuration file
* `MobileNetSSD_deploy.caffemodel` – Pre-trained weights
* `output_video_with_signal.mp4` – Final processed video with detection and signal overlay

## 🖼️ **Output Behavior**

> 🟢 **More persons** → "All clear!"
> 🔴 **More vehicles** → "Stay safe!"
> 🟡 **Equal** → "Proceed with caution!"

## 🚀 **Run on Google Colab**

1. Upload your video in `.mp4` format.
2. Run all the notebook cells:

   * 📥 Download and load model
   * 🧠 Perform detection
   * 🎞️ Save and download output video
3. View or share your **smart detection video**.

---

## 📈 **Possible Future Enhancements**

* 🔄 Switch to `YOLOv8` or TensorFlow Lite for faster and more accurate detection.
* 🧾 Log detection data to a `.csv` file for analysis.
* 📊 Build a simple dashboard to visualize detection stats.
* 📷 Add support for real-time webcam-based detection.
